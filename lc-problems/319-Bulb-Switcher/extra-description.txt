I didn't see a full description of this solution that didn't leave me with follow-up questions so I decided to write one that I hope is satisfing to a broader audience.

-Each bulb is toggled for each number lower than it that divides it evenly
-That is a bulb will be on if it has an even number of unique divisors
-This happens only when a number is a perfect square since all divisors can be grouped in pairs (d, n/d)
-The pair has two unique values except for the case of d = n/d i.e d*d = n or n is a perfect square

    //so we count the perect squares <= n
    if (n < 1) return 0;
    
    int cnt = 2;
    while (cnt*cnt <= n) cnt++;
    
    return cnt-1;
    
    //equivalently floor(sqrt(n)) will give the number of perfect squares less <= n
    //since for all numbers <= this value we have num*num <= n
