###372: Super Pow

This program is based on [Euler's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem) which states that: $a^{ \phi(n) } = 1 (mod\ n)$, where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's Totient Function, provided that a and n are relatively prime (meaning they have no common factors). In our case, $n = 1337$, which has prime factorization $1337 = 7 \times 191$. We know that $\phi(p) = p - 1$ when p is prime and also that $\phi(p \times q) = phi(p) \times phi(q)$. Thus it follows that $\phi(1337) = phi(7 x 191) = phi(7) x phi(191) = 6 x 190 = 1140$. Thus, using Euler's Theorem it follows that $a^{1140} = 1 (mod 1337)$, provided that $a$ and $1337$ have no common factors. Since $1337$ only has two factors, $7$ and $191$, it follows that $a^{1140} = 1 (mod\ 1337)$, provided that a is not divisible by $7$ or $191$. This makes sense intuitively because one can only find an inverse of a number $(mod\ n)$, if the number is relatively prime to n. No multiple of $7$ or $191$ will ever be congruent to $1\ mod\ 1337$ because they are factors of $1337$. The closest you can get to $1\ mod\ 1337$, is getting$ 0\ mod\ 1337$. For this reason, it is very important that we never allow $1$ to be the answer in the case when a is divisible by $7$ or $9$ since that doesn't make sense.

Since $a^{1140} = 1 (mod\ 1337)$, provided that a is not divisible by $7$ or $191$, it follows that if we write $b = 1140q + r$ (where q is the quotient and r is the remainder after dividing b by 1140), then 

$a^b = a^{1140q + r} = a^{1140q} \times a^r = (a^{1140})^q \times a^r = 1^q \times a^r = a^r (mod\ 1337)$. 

Thus if we reduce $b (mod\ 1337)$ we can find the answer to $a^b$ by instead just doing $a^r$ (i.e. $a^{b \% 1337}$). Furthermore since we want our answer mod $1337$, it is wise to reduce a mod $1337$ to keep the numbers smaller. Thus, provided that a is not divisible by $7$ or $191$, it follows by Euler's Theorem that $a^b = (a \%1337)^{(b \% 1140)} \% 1337$.

However, we must carefuly reflect on the case when a is divisible by $7$ or $191$. If it is divisible by both, then obviously a mod $1337$ is $0$ and our answer is $0$. However, if it is divisisble by one of them and if $b = 0\ mod\ 1140$ (i.e. $b$ is a multiple of $1140$), then our problem would reduce to $(7n)^0 = 1 (mod\ 1337)$ or $(191m)^0 = 1 (mod\ 1337)$. These are obviously wrong because a multiple of $7$ or $191$ can never be congruent to $1$ mod $1337$. They are also an impermissible application of Euler's Theorem because Euler's Theorem requires that a and n be relatively prime. The way around this issue is to be careful to not use $r = 0$, which will occur when $b$ is divisible by $1140$. Using $r = 0$ will lead to an incorrect result. What we will do in this case is if $b\ mod\ 1140 = 0$, then we will use $b = 1140$ instead. This will keep the $0$ from being in the exponent. However, we do not have to check it with an if statement, we can simply always add $1140$ to $b\ mod\ 1140$ for all cases. This will give us the correct result in the cases when $a$ and $b$ are not divisible by $7$ or $191$ but will also protect us for the case when they are divisible by $7$ or $191$.

The program then simply converts the list $b$ to a string then a long int. It then reduces $b mod 1140$ and adds $1140$ to that result so we never have to worry about getting a $0$ in the exponent. The program finally evaluates $(a \% 1337)^{(1140 + b \% 1140)} \% 1337$ which gives us the correct final answer.
