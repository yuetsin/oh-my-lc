    "\n",
    "To find the idle time, consider figure 1 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "From this figure, we can observe that the maximum number of idle slots will always be given by the product of the cooling time and the number of instances of the task with maximum count less 1(in case only multiple instances of the same task need to be executed, and each, then, is executed after lapse of every cooling time). The factor of 1 is deducted from the task's count with maximum number of instances, as is clear from the figure, is that in the last round of execution of the tasks, the idle slots need not be considered for insertion following the execution of the related task. Now, based on the count of the instances of the other tasks, we can reduce the number of idle slots from this maximum value, to determine the minimum number of idle slots needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, consider figure 2 as shown above. From the figure above, assuming the tasks are executed in row-wise order, we can see that in case the number of instances of another task equal the number of instances of the task with maximum number of instances, the number of idle slots saved is equal to its number of instances less 1 as is clear for the case of task B above. But, if the count of the number of instances, say \n",
    "i\n",
    "i is lesser than the this maximum value, the number of idle slots saved is equal to the value \n",
    "i\n",
    "i itself as is clear for the case of task C. Further, we can observe that for any arbitrary task other than A, B or C with the count of number of instances lesser than C, this task can be easily accomodated into the idle slots or if no more idle slot is available, this task can be appended after every row of tasks without interfering with the cooling time. In the first case, subtracting its number of intances from the number of idle slots leads to obtaining the correct number of available idle slots. In the second case, which will only occur if the number of idle slots pending is already zero, it leads to negative net idle slots, which can later be considered as zero for the purpose of calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can easily obtain the number of pending idle slots by subtracting appropriate number of slots from the available ones and at the end, we can obtain the total time required as the sum of pending idle slots and the total number of tasks."
