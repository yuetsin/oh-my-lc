I see a lot of solutions using gcd, but no one explains why it works. So I do some research and find out that the problem is just like a implementation of a math theory named "Bezout's Lemma". I copy the definition below, and you can find the proof of it on google if you are interested in it.

Bezout's Lemma states that if x and y are nonzero integers and g = gcd(x,y), then there exist integers a and b such that ax+by=g. In other words, there exists a linear combination of x and y equal to g.

Furthermore, g is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed in this form, i.e. g = min{ax+by | a, b in Z, ax+by > 0}.
