    "This is actually an encoding problem.\n",
    "First define attempt = minutesToTest/MinutesToDie\n",
    "As all other post says, with x pigs, you could test up to (attempt+1)^x buckets. But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "First define base = (attempt+1), it is the base of encoding, and we label buckets from 0~N-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see example of attempt=1 so base = 2, meaning to use binary encoding to represent bucket j, we let pig i to drink bucket j if j's i bit is 1 (For instance pig 1 drink bucket 1/3/5/7 ...)\n",
    "If the pig dies, we know the poionous bucket has 1 in j's bit and o otherwise. View all pigs death, we then know for each position whether it should be 1 or 0. Thus with x pigs, we could encode and predict x^2 buckets\n",

    "If pig 1 die we know bucket has 1 in first bit 0 otherwise\n",
    "If pig 2 die we know bucket has 1 in second bit 0 otherwise\n",
    "If pig 3 die we know bucket has 1 in third bit 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarily, let attempt =x-1 and base = x, we use x base encoding to represent bucket j, and let pig i to drink bucket j at attempt k if bucket j's i bit is k, if pig dies, then we know the bucket's i bit has a value of k."
